	* src/cobo.c : Adjusted timeouts so parent avoids dropping connection
	  due to slow child.  Upon connection, reply timeouts increase with
	  time.  Fixed barrier() to use allreduce rather than a gather.

	* src/cobo.c : Add timeout to read_fd when establishing connection
	  using poll() so we don't hang if we ending up connecting to a process
	  that isn't one of ours.

	* src/cobo.h,
	  src/cobo.c : Added sessionid as a new parameter during open call.
	  This value is checked at connection setup time.

	* test/server.c : Added server process that just connects and sends
	  hostlist to rank 0 rather than start all ranks, use this when using
	  a launcher like srun to start the clients.
